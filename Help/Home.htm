<P><STRONG>Summary</STRONG></P>
<P>This application provides a very simple user interface 
which allows virtually anybody to be able to download many repositories at once. 
Currently, it is only to set up to download a ZIP file of the latest code in the default branch. 
Future versions will support multiple branches and more data downloaded in various 
formats.</P>

You must first configure the application before you can 
use it. This requires obtaining a <A href="https://github.com/settings/tokens" 
target=_blank>personal access token from your GitHub account developer 
settings</A>, and using that token here, if you 
want to access any private repositories. Otherwise, without this, you will have 
public visibility and limited access. &nbsp;You must 
go to your&nbsp;<A href="Account_Setup.htm">account setup</A> in this application, and 
enter that token. To open the setup, go to the "Options" menu             at 
the top, and then choose        
            
"Setup".</P>

&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Choose Source Account</STRONG>        
            
         
            
</P>
<P>        
            
You need to specify either a user or an organization by 
their unique name. Enter that into the <A href="Repository_Setup.htm">repository 
setup</A>. The application will display a list of all repositories in that user 
or organization which are accessible from the account behind the <A 
href="Account_Setup.htm">selected account</A>        
            
           
            
             
              
            
.</P>
<P>        
            
&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Choose Download Location</STRONG>        
            
</P>
<P>        
            
You will also need to&nbsp;<A 
href="Repository_Setup.htm">choose a folder</A> somewhere on your computer or 
network where you wish to download these files. By default, this is in your "My 
Documents" folder, but you probably want to choose another        
            
location.</P>

<P><STRONG>Listing Repositories</STRONG>        
            
</P>
<P>        
            
The main screen of the application allows you to fetch a 
complete&nbsp;<A href="Listing_Repositories.htm">list of all repositories</A> 
you have access to under any given user or organization account. You can apply 
sorting, and later you will be able to filter them        
            
too.</P>

<P><STRONG>Choosing Repositories</STRONG>        
            
</P>
<P>        
            
You can&nbsp;<A href="Choosing_Repositories.htm">place a 
check</A> next to any repository you wish to back up, or you can also check all. 
The selection will allow you to bulk-download ZIP files for each repository all 
at        
            
once.</P>

<P><STRONG>Downloading Repositories</STRONG>        
            
</P>
<P>        
            
Once you have made your selection, you can click the 
"Download" button to <A href="Download_Repositories.htm">initiate the 
download</A>        
            
          
     . This part will take time, depending 
on the number of repositories and their size. Note that the "size" GitHub 
reports is not accurate, and therefore there's no real chance of implementing 
estimated        
            
time.</P>

<P>Once you have checked on all the repositories you want 
to download, press the "Download" button. This will begin the actual download 
process. This will take time, and there is a progress bar that appears. The 
taskbar icon also displays the progress.</P>

<P>In case any errors occur during downloading, an error 
log will appear at the bottom of the screen. This displays the specific files 
and the errors which happened. Note that user cancelling the download also is treated as 
an error, so if you choose to cancel the download, it will show you 
the error log. You can close the error log by pressing the "X" 
button to the far right of it, or it will disappear automatically the next time you 
start a download.</P>

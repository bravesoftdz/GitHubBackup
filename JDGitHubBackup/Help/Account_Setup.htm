<P>Before you can access private repositories, you will first need to 
obtain a <A href="https://github.com/settings/tokens" target=_blank>Personal 
Access Token from your GitHub account developer settings</A> . This is a unique 
token which you will further need to enter into the setup. The application will 
be able to access any public or private repositories which    the token 
you provide is able to access. Your visibility will be that of           
          the account 
behind the provided personal access token. Without a token, you will only have public visibility, 
as well as limited number of calls to the API. So it's strongly 
recommended to set up your own token.</P>
